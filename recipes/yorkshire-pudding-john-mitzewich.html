    <h4>As legend has it, Yorkshire puddings were traditionally cooked in a pan of fat, at the bottom of a hearth, underneath a large piece of roasting beef. 
        The smoky heat from the fire, along with all the other goodness dripping into the pan from the meat, must've made for quite a delicious pastry. 
        Though limited by modern ovens, we can still come close to the original by using real rendered beef fat, without which you're just eating a popover.</h4>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>Yields 12 servings</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>"4 large eggs"</li>
        <li>"1 tsp kosher salt"</li>
        <li>"7/8 cup all-purpose flour"</li>
        <li>"1 cup whole milk"</li>
        <li>"3/4 cup melted beef fat"</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>"1. Whisk eggs and salt together in a bowl until light and frothy. Whisk in flour and milk until smooth and lump-free; batter will be thin and barely coat the back of a spoon."</li>
        <li>"2. Transfer batter to a 4-cup measuring cup and chill in the refrigerator, at least 15 minutes."</li>
        <li>"3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)."</li>
        <li>"4. Fill each cup of a 12-cup nonstick muffin tin with 1 tablespoon melted beef fat; use your finger to grease the sides and tops of the cups. Place the muffin tin on a baking sheet."</li>
        <li>"5. Heat in the preheated oven on the middle rack until fat is smoking hot, 10 to 15 minutes."</li>
        <li>"6. Remove from the oven and fill each muffin cup halfway full with batter."</li>
        <li>"7. Bake pudding in the preheated oven until browned and fully puffed, about 25 minutes more. Remove from the oven and immediately poke a hole in the center of each to release steam. Serve hot, warm, or room-temperature.</li>
    </ol>
